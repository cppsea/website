The website is purposely written in vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks to allow anyone to quickly contribute to our codebase without any prerequisite knowledge of a particular technology.

## Getting Started
Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any code editor of choice. It's recommended to use VS code because of the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension by Ritwick Dey, which automatcially refresh the website when changes are detected.
